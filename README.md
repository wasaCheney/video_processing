## Video Processing with OpenCV and Matplotlib

This is a simple example for video processing based on
OpenCV and Matplotlib. When there are lots of videos waiting
for text adding, the code could help.

OpenCV is used for video reading, while Maplotlib is used for
text adding.

The code has an apparent flaw that the output video has left/right
white margin. I search solutions on the internet for several hours but
could not get anything satisfying. If you could solve it, contact me please.
